                    <p>Life below water is vital for regulating climate, producing oxygen, and supporting biodiversity. Oceans provide food, medicine, and livelihoods while protecting coastal communities from storms. However, pollution, overfishing, and climate change threaten these ecosystems, making their preservation crucial for the planet's health and human survival.</p>
